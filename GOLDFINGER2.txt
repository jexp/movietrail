ACTOR# SMITHERS
We here at the Bank of England, Mister Bond, are the official depository for gold bullion, just as Fort Knox, Kentucky is for the United States.  We know, of course, the amounts we each hold, we know the amounts deposited in other banks, and we can estimate what is being held for industrial purposes.  This enables the two governments to establish respectively the true value of the dollar and the pound.  Consequently, we are vitally concerned with unauthorized leakages.
