Bond turns the dial activating the scope. It alights. The beep indicator is stationary again, near a mountainside.
Puzzled, Bond looks off as if the source is nearby, then he looks at the scope again.
The indicator remains stationary. We hear Tilly again:

runs back past the sign, mounts a fire-escape ladder and starts climbing up. He stops on a ledge, then climbs up to the next level.

BOND'S POV - THE FACTORY ENTRANCE
Ling exits the factory then leans against a railing as Goldfinger follows.
LING Perhaps it would be wiser to
suspend your other activities.
GOLDFINGER Now, Mister Ling, please assure your principals Operation Grand
Slam will have my undivided attention.
Goldfinger leads him down a few steps and around a corner of the building.

Goldfinger hesitates. Bond looks over at him, then back at the table. The beam keeps cutting.
Bond looks at Goldfinger again. Goldfinger smiles, relenting. He turns back and snaps his fingers (soundlessly) at his assistants.
EXTREME LONG SHOT
The laser beam switches off as Kisch walks down the steps from the control room.
BOND looks up at the laser gun then down at his legs.

GOLDFINGER You are quite right, Mister Bond.
You are worth more to me alive. WIDE ANGLE
As Bond lies in f.g. and Goldfinger looks on, Kisch approaches the table.
Bond looks up at Kisch, then Goldfinger, then Kisch. Kisch raises a large pistol and points it at Bond's chest.
Goldfinger looks on smugly as Kisch aims.
Kisch fires the pistol; it makes a thumping sound. Bond's head lowers to the tabletop.
Goldfinger looks on with even greater smugness. LONG SHOT
We see the entire tableau -- Bond unconscious, Kisch beside him and Goldfinger looking on.

BOND Uh, Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns. Pussy looks back at him.
BOND That's a Smith and Wesson forty-

Goldfinger takes a pool cue from a rack by the table. PAN on him as he crosses to the aerial photo. It depicts Fort Knox and the surrounding area.
GOLDFINGER (pointing with the cue)
This is my bank. The gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen. In its vaults are fifteen billion dollars -- the entire gold supply of the United States.
STRAP (laughing)
Knock off Fort Knox?! The gangsters laugh at him.
LAURENCE Got a key or somethin'?

Of a kind. PAN on him as he walks back to the console.
SOLO There are thirty-five thousand
troops stationed around there.

Goldfinger turns the white dials again and the humming sound resumes.

The guard sits staring at him. Bond waves to him again and turns away. The guard continues to watch expressionless.
Bond paces to the bars again and smiles at the guard. The guard stares back. Bond winks at him. The guard stares back. Bond smiles and suddenly lowers himself below the window.
The guard keeps looking. Bond is no longer visible. THE GUARD

applause for centuries.

Seven of the gangsters are lined up on the platform facing Goldfinger. He holds the pool cue and approaches Solo.

UNDER THE MODEL
Bond stands on the hydraulic platform. He jumps down, looks around, tears a piece of paper from a rolled-up document and grabs a pencil.
He runs back under the model and looks through it again.
Meanwhile
we hear Goldfinger continue:
GOLDFINGER (O.S.) I call it Operation Grand Slam. I
have devoted fifteen years of my life to it. Every detail has been scrupulously prepared. Every eventuality has been considered. We'll operate on a split-second schedule. Your organization, Mister Midnight, brought in a consignment of these canisters...

GOLDFINGER ... which runs past the depository
here, and intersects with Gold Vault Road. This fence surrounding the depository, as Mister Strap reminded us, is electrified. It will be dynamited. My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it.
----102.
SOLO How, may I ask?
GOLDFINGER You made that possible, Mister
Solo, by arranging, through your considerable influence in shipping circles, to bring through customs uninspected a consignment labeled machine parts. All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored.
SOLO I've heard enough.
STRAP Let him finish.
SOLO (interrupting)
If you have no objection... (to Goldfinger)
... I'll take my money now.
STRAP What's the matter, Solo? Too big
for you to handle?
Goldfinger looks over at other gangsters. They look back at him. He looks at another group of gangsters. They look back.
Under the
model, Bond watches.
GOLDFINGER Gentlemen, we must respect Mister
Solo's decision. Please excuse me for a few minutes while I take care of him. Make yourselves comfortable.
Goldfinger leads Solo toward the door. UNDER THE MODEL
Bond takes the Homer from his heel, folds the paper around it and slips it into his pocket.
He looks through the model again. He hears general hubbub from the gangsters, and a few clear words:
FIRST GANGSTER How do we get it out?
----103.
SECOND GANGSTER That's the bit I want to hear.
THIRD GANGSTER Yeah, and it had better be good.
TILT DOWN to Bond's feet. Suddenly a pair of hands grab his ankles and yank on them. He falls face-down onto the platform.
The hands pull him back and hurl him against a wall. He turns around and suddenly stops.
His assailant is Pussy. She glares at him with her hands on her hips.
BOND Pussy! Well, who taught you judo?
She holds her hand out. DOLLY BACK as she steps forward; a guard crosses behind her.
PUSSY The gun you took.
BOND Oh, the gun. The gun, of course.

The guard closes the trunk. Solo glances up. Goldfinger notices and looks back.
Pussy walks up to them with Bond. Bond takes his hand from his pocket, holding the piece of paper with the Homer.

We were quite right to spare Mister Bond's life in Switzerland. If those gentlemen are his friends, let us convince them he needs no assistance. For their benefit, Pussy, let's make him as happy as possible. I suggest you change into something more suitable.

Ah, Mister Bond. Sit down, please. A mint julep? Traditional, but satisfying.
BOND
Yes, thanks. (to the servant)

The servant nods and walks away.

GOLDFINGER Go on, Mister Bond.
BOND Mister Ling, the Red Chinese agent at the factory. He's a specialist

Goldfinger smiles back at him.
BOND His government's given you a bomb!
GOLDFINGER I prefer to call it an atomic
device. It's small, but particularly dirty.
BOND Cobalt and iodine?
Precisely.
GOLDFINGER
BOND Well, if you explode it in Fort
Knox, the, uh, entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for... fifty-seven years!
GOLDFINGER Fifty-eight, to be exact.
BOND I apologize, Goldfinger. It's an
inspired deal. They get what they want -- economic chaos in the West -- and the value of your gold increases many times.
GOLDFINGER I conservatively estimate ten
times.
----115.
BOND Brilliant. But the atomic device,
as you call it, is already, obviously in this country.
Obviously.
GOLDFINGER
BOND But bringing it to Fort Knox, uh,
undetected could be risky -- very risky.
GOLDFINGER Oh the contrary, Mister Bond. The
risk is all on your side. If the authorities should attempt to locate it, who knows where it might be exploded, eh? Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London, Cape Kennedy, near the White House... But we are speculating idly. Operation Grand Slam will be successful. You will be there to see for yourself -- to closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

He bangs on the back of the truck and walks off with it. Pussy crosses behind Bond and links an arm through his.
PUSSY Well, how about it, handsome?
Don't you think it's about time we got to know each other socially?
BOND Well, the new Miss Galore. Where

Oh, uh, I never carry weapons after business hours.

She recovers and looks back, glaring. Bond smiles, walks toward her and sits beside her.
BOND There. Now let's both play.
She tries to kick him but he jumps on top of her. She places her hands at his throat, trying to push him away, but he steadily lowers himself. She turns her head to the side.
She hurls his butt in hay. He looks back at her. She exhales.
